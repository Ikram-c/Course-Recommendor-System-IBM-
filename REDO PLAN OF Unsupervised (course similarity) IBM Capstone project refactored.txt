-> import libraries

-> import CSVs as pandas databases:

    -> course_df = course_genre.csv
    -> sim_df = sim.csv
    -> test_users_df = rs_content_test.csv



# Cell 2
-> Initialize function: generate_recommendations_for_one_user:
    
    -> Allow for a threshold value to be put in as well


# Cell 3
-> Initialize function: generate_recommendations_for_all:

    -> Allow for a threshold value to be put in as well

    -> Strip out the Csvs


# Cell 4
modified version of:

res_dict = {}
users, courses, sim_scores = generate_recommendations_for_all()
res_dict['USER'] = users
res_dict['COURSE_ID'] = courses
res_dict['SCORE'] = sim_scores
res_df = pd.DataFrame(res_dict, columns=['USER', 'COURSE_ID', 'SCORE'])

with the hyper param being the threshold passed in
